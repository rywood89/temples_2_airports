# temples_2_airports

I built this app for fun to explore the distance of the nearest airport (with an air traffic control tower) to The Church of Jesus Chirst of Latter-day Saint (LDS) temples. There have been some stats thrown around that world-wide, the average member of the LDS church is less than 200 miles away from an active temple. I wanted to try my hand at identifying proximity of temples to something, so I chose airports.

Current app: https://ryanwoodbury89.shinyapps.io/temple_2_airport/

I wanted to try three things with this app:

- 1. Build an app from start to finish
- 2. Use maps (e.g., leaflet)
- 3. Compare distances between LDS temples and airports.

Some future add-ons:

- Add a reactive table that lists the temples with some more of their info
- Add a smaller points of all the airports (within the filter input?)
- Add a radius marker (in miles) around temples based on filter input
